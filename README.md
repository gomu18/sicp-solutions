This package contains the solutions to the exercises in the book Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html).
Exercises which require code are tested in DrRacket with sicp package. Exercises which are theory based or computation based would just have answers/minimal explanations.
